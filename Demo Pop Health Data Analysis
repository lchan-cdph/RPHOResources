Demographic Count Data Analysis with Non-parametric and stochastic methods 

Load and Inspect Data 
# Load the dataset demographic_count_data <- read.csv("demographic_count_data.csv") 

# Display the first few rows 
head (demographic_count_data) 

Data Cleaning 
# Check for missing values 
summary(demographic_count_data) 

Exploratory Data Analysis 
# Create a bar plot of demographic ratio count by city 
ggplot(demographic_count_data, aes(x = City, y = Demographic_Count / 
  (Demographic_Count + 
Non_Demographic_Count))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lightblue") + 
labs(title = "Demographic Ratio Count by City", x = "City", y = "Demographic Ratio Count") 

Non-parametric test for Differences in Ratios 
# Perform a Wilcoxon rank-sum test for differences in ratios 
wilcox_test(Demographic_Count / 
(Demographic_Count + 
Non_Demographic_Count) ~ City, data = 
demographic_count_data) 

Stochastic Modeling of Demographic Ratios 
# Stochastic modeling using simulations 
set.seed(123) # Set seed for reproducibility 
simulated_ratios <- replicate(1000, { 
sample(demographic_count_data$Demographic_Count / 
(demographic_count_data$Demographic_Count + 
demographic_count_data$Non_Demographic_Count), replace = TRUE)
})

# Plot the distribution of simulated ratios 
hist(apply(simulated_ratios, 1, mean), 
main = "Simulated Mean Demographic Ratios", xlab = Mean Demographic Ratio") 

# Plot the heatmap 
library(pheatmap)
# Create a location-based heatmap of demographic ratio counts 
ggplot(demographic_count_data, aes(x = Year, y = City, fill = Demographic_Count / (Demographic_Count + Non_Demographic_Count))) + 
geom_tile() + scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "blue") +
